PS_FacebookConnect
==================

Module 'Facebook Connect' for Prestashop 1.5 (version alpha)

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This module was a part of a more complex system that I developed because I could not find a free 
FB mechanism for PS 1.5. It has been simplified to be autonomous.</p>

I will update it to make it cleaner and more customizable. :)
